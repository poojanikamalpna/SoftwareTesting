#    list operators


# list can indexed like a string 
# list is mutable
# list index have fix index we can add extra number in list we just change the list item in the list


#list indexing
# alist=["red","green","yellow","blue","white"]
# print(alist[0:2])
# print(alist[1:3])
# print(len(alist))
 
# sort the index
# result=alist.sort()   # list will be sort out by its order a to z
# print(f"the a list before sort : {alist}")
# print(f"list after a sorting : {result}")


avalue=[33,45,66,34,57,98,80,20]
#print(blist[0::2]) #it will take 1 in increament
result=avalue.sort(reverse=True)
print(result)
